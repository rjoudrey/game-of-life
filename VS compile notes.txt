Built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

Debug:
C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library = Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd)
Linker -> System -> SubSystem = Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)

Release:
C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library = Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)
Linker -> System -> SubSystem = Windows (/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS)


Both:
VC++ Directories -> Include Directories = add the "SDL include & lib\include" folder.
VC++ Directories -> Library Directories = add the "SDL include & lib\lib" folder.
Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies = "SDLmain.lib;SDL_ttf.lib;SDL.lib;"


(VC++ Directories are in the options menu in VC++ 2008 instead of the project settings).
